This is a driver for ADSC <http://www.adsc-xray.com/> detectors.  It has been
tested with the ADSC Q210.  While not yet tested with other models, it should 
work with the ADSC Q4 (with the upgrade to four computers), Q4r, Q210, Q210r,
Q270, Q315, and Q315r.

Please consult ../../documentation/adscDoc.html for the complete documentation
for this driver.

This driver was written by J. Lewis Muir <jlmuir@anl.gov>.  It was based
on (i.e. copied and modified) the Prosilica driver by Mark Rivers.

Thanks to Mark Rivers (University of Chicago) for developing the areaDetector
software and Chris Nielsen (ADSC) for providing information on the use of the
ADSC detector control library.
